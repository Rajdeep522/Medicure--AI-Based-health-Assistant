                <p id="abc">People have very less time to concentrate on their health because of their busy lifestyles. Consulting the doctor every time we fall ill is a tedious task, people, therefore, tend to search for easily accessible resources available on the Internet because of which they tend to make wrong decisions by taking medicines that may not be suitable for their symptoms. Referring to these resources for remedies based on the given symptoms is not recommended, even a common cold is referred to as something very serious which makes the person also start panicking. With the help of machine learning, we can help to solve this problem by training a model to predict the disease based on given symptoms.</p>

                    This project aims to design a web application for the users to identify the
                    disease they have been infected with based on the symptoms they have
                    been suffering with a given confidence score. This prevents people from
                    doing random google search and is intended to provide correct information
                    to the user. It provides a convenient and accessible tool for individuals to
                    self-assess their health conditions. This application could be especially
                    useful for those who live in remote areas without easy access to healthcare
                    mainly focusing on the students who live in distant places and are unable to
                    reach any health care professional frequently.
